            The main intention of this website is to share opinion about the books that I have read. I have tryed to include a space for the users to post their reviews as well. I have plans to include more features to this website eventually. You can see that the name of this website is "Paperpillow" - means pillow is the thing that is made using a soft material and used to place our head. Here I am saying that a pillow made up of paper.
             But by that I symbolised book as the best place to bravely place our head. 
             Also it should be the best place to put our head in all comfort.
